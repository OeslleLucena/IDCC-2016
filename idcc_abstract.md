abstract: |
  The combination of increasing demands for more systematic data management planning in support of effective in-project data management, research data sharing, and long-term preservation of discovery and access; increasing volumes of data being created and used in research; and research support budgets that aren't increasing in proportion to these demands is creating a situation in which greater efficiencies and product-centered research data management workflows and processes are needed. Taking inspiration from the principles and practices of agile software development, the presenters of this poster are working towards the development of three sets of interdependent products. First, a set of *core principles* that have broad support within the community will be identified and/or developed from existing statements of principles; solicited from the broad community of research data creators, curators, and users; and derived from implicit principles exemplified by specific research data projects that have achieved notable success in enabling efficient use, preservation, discovery and reuse. Second, building upon the case studies identified and reviewed as part of the aforementioned process of identifying core data management principles, additional case studies are being sought that demonstrate effective research data management practices that are aligned with the identified principles and have resulted in well-preserved, and documented data sets that well-positioned for discovery and reuse.
