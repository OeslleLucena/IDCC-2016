# IDCC-2016

Repository for materials related to the group's 2017 IDCC poster presentation

Posters enable individuals or groups to display information about innovative projects or activities in an informative, interactive environment. Posters will be displayed in the Foyer area outside the auditorium and there will be a dedicated poster slot to ensure all delegates have time to see the posters which interest them. Poster proposals should be submitted as one-page abstracts, although the poster itself is also an acceptable form of submission.  A poster PDF will need to be submitted prior to the conference.
The ideal poster should be designed to attract attention, provide a brief overview of your work and initiate discussion. Posters need to be as simple and as clear as possible with an emphasis on graphics rather than text. Posters should adhere to the following guidelines:

* A1 portrait or landscape - 594mm x 841mm or approximately 33.1" x 23.4"
* Your poster should be one piece and not made up of separate sections.
* Your poster should include title, author(s) names, affiliations, institutional logos, where appropriate, and email addresses
